# CHAPTER 3: ANSIBLE PLAYBOOK

[Git repository](https://github.com/kabary/rhce8?ref=linuxhandbook.com)

## First note
Ansible support YAML format, subfix is either .yml or .yaml its up to you.

### yaml format

1. note

- --- begining of a yaml file
- ... end of a yaml file
- you can specify lists (array) on a single line
- Tab are not allow in YAML file
- There are white space between different elements of YAML
- YAML allows UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32 encoding

2. Tip

you can use tab as space by edit .vimrc  file as below

`autocmd FileType yaml setlocal ai ts=2 sw=2 et`

3. Simple playbook

```
---
- name: first play
  host: all
  tasks:
    - name: create new file
      file:
        path: /tmp/foo.txt
        ower: cloud_user
        mode: 0644
        state: touch
```

Run playbook:

`#ansible-playbook playbook_name.yml`

you also execute all above tasks with adhoc-command as bellow

`#ansible all -m file -a "path=/tmp/foo.txt mode=0644 owner=cloud_user state=touch"`

## Running multiple plays with ansible playbook

## Verifying your playbook

- checking syntax

`#ansible-playbook all -i inventory --syntax-check playbook_name.yml`

- Checking without run on managed node 

`#ansible-playbook all -i inventory --check playbok_name.yml`

- List host 

`#ansible-playbook all -i inventory --list-hosts playbook_name.yml`

- List tasks

`#ansible-playbook all -i inventory --list-tasks playbok_name.yml`

## Reusing tasks and PLAYBOOK

Create file contain all tasks which you want to reuse

```
[cloud_user@09bf0c716a1c ansible]$ cat group_tasks.yml
- name: create developer group
  group:
    name: developers
- name: create security group
  group:
    name: security
- name: create finance group
  group:
    name: finance
```

Use "import_tasks" directive to run all task defined in group_tasks file

```
---
- name: first play
  hosts: all
  tasks: 
    - name: create a new file
      file:
        path: /tmp/foo.conf
        mode: 0664
        owner: elliot
        state: touch
    
    - name: create groups
      import_tasks: group-tasks.yml
```

You can also use "import_playbook" module to reuse a plabook

```
---
- name: Reusing playbooks
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Reboot the servers
      reboot:
        msg: Server is rebooting ...

- name: Run first playbook
  import_playbook: first-playbook.yml
```

Note: You can also use "include" directive to reuse a playbook and tasks.

```
---
- name: Reusing playbooks
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Reboot the servers
      reboot:
        msg: Server is rebooting ...

- name: Run first playbook
  include: first-playbook.yml
```

Different between "include" and "import_playbook" is "import_playbook" are preprocessed at the time playbook are parese. On the other hand "include" are processed as they are encountered during the execution of plabook.

## Reusing selective tasks and plays on PLAYBOOK

This case you should use "tags" when defined PLAYBOOK. then use the "--tags" option when call "ansible-playbook" command as below:

```
---
- name: first play
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: install tmux
      package:
        name: tmux
        state: present
    
    - name: create an archive
      archive:
        path: /var/log
        dest: /tmp/logs.tar.gz
        format: gz

- name: second play
  hosts: node4
  tasks:
    - name: install git
      apt:
        name: git
        state: present
      tags: git
```

then

`#ansible-playbook multiple-plays.yml --tags git`
