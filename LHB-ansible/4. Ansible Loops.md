# Chapter 5 ANSIBLE LOOPS
## Looping over list

See detail as bellow example:

```
---
- name: loop example
  hosts: all
  vars:
    - list_num: [1,3,4,5,6]
  
  tasks:
    - name: print out five elements of list
      debug:
        msg: "{{ item }}"
      loop: "{{ list_num }}"
```

```
---
- name: Add multiple user
  hosts: all
  vars:
    dbuser:
      - username: j1
        pass: pass1
      - username: j2
        pass: pass2
      - username: j3
        pass: pass3
  
  tasks:
    - name: Add users
      user:
        name: "{{ item.username }}"
        password: "{{ item.pass | password_hash('sha512') }}"
      loop: "{{ dbuser }}"
```

Note: 
- Ansile loop just support list type, and unsupport dictionary type. 
- User module not allow unencrypted setting password

## Looping over dictionaries

As mentioned above, ansible loop dont supported dictionaires type. 
wokr around is "dict2items" filter to convert a dictionaires to list

```
---
- name: Print Dictionary
  hosts: node1
  vars:
    employee: 
      name: "Elliot Alderson"
      title: "Penetration Tester"
      company: "Linux Handbook"
  tasks:
    - name: Print employee dictionary
      debug:
        msg: "{{ item }}"
      loop: "{{ employee | dict2items }}"
```

## Looping over a  range of numbers

Use range() function

```
---
- name: Range loop playbook
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: range loop
      debug:
        msg: "{{ items }}"
      loop: "{{ range(10) | list }}"
    
    - name: range of specific number
      debug:
        msg: "{{ items }}"
      loop: "{{ range(5,50,2) | list }}"
```

## Looping over inventory files

using built-in ansible variable "groups"

```
---
- name: looping over inventory
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Ping all hosts in inventory file
      command: ping -c 1 {{ items }}
      loop:  "{{ groups['all'] }}"

    - name: Ping specific hosts in inventory file
      command: ping -c 2 {{ items }}
      loop: "{{ groups['dbserver'] }}"
```

## Pausing within loops

Using "pause" and "loop_control" directive for achieved that purpose.

```
---
- name: loop control playbook
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: countdown happy birthday
      debug:
        msg: "{{ 10 - item }} second remaing..."
      loop: "{{ range(10) | list }}"
      loop_control:
        pause: 1
    
    - name: Display Happy Birthday
      debug:
        msg: Happy Birthday
```
