# Chapter 8: ENCRYPTING CONTENT WITH ANSIBLE VAULT
## Creating encrypted files

`# ansible-vault create secret.txt` 
Note: secret.txt is the file which is encrypted


To view ecrypted file by ansible-vault: 
`#ansible-vault view secret.txt`
or
`#ansible-vault view secret.txt --vault-password-file secret-vault.txt`
note: "secret-vault.txt" contain secret password to decrypt ansible-vault file

## Decrypting encrypted file

`#ansible-vault decrypt secret.txt`

You can encrypt the existing files again:

`#ansible-vault encrypt secret_file.txt`

To change the vault password

`#ansible-vault rekey secret_file.txt`

## Decrypting content at runtime in playbooks

Creating files then encrypted by vault
`#ansible-vault create db-server.yml`
`#ansible-vault encrypt web-server.yml`

```
