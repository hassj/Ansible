# Chapter 4: ANSIBLE VARIABLE, FACT and REGISTER
## Part 1: Working with variable

1. Defining and referencing variable

Using "vars" keyword to working with variable

```
---
- name: working with variable
  hosts: all
  vars:
    fav_color: yellow
```

To get value of variable use double curly brackets as follows:

```
---
- name: working with variable
  hosts: all
  vars:
    fav_color: yellow
  tasks:
    - name: show color value - task 1
      debug:
        msg: My favorite color is {{ fav_color }}
    
    - name: show me second color which you like -task 2
      debug:
        msg: "{{ fav_color }}" also is my best color which i like!
```

> Note: 
> Different between two tasks is position of variable, second task have single quote used when variable is only or first elemet in line.
> Debug module used for print the message to stout

2. Creating list and dictionaries
 
As folows simple:

```
---
- name: working with variables
  hosts: all
  vars:
    port_nums: [21,22,23,24]
    port_nums_v2:
      - 30
      - 32
      - 44
    users:
      bob:
        username: bob
        uid: 12
        shell: /bin/bash
      lisa:
        username: lisa
        uid: 13
        shell: /bin/bash
  tasks:
    - name: show 2nd item in port nums
      debug:
        msg: SSH port is {{ port_nums[1] }}

    - name: show uid of Bob and Lisa
      debug:
        msg: UID of Bob {{ users.bob.uid }} and Lisa {{ users.['lisa'].['uid'] }}
```

3. Including external variables

Just like you can import tasks ans playbook, you can do the same thing with variables.

- Step1: Defining list of var name: var_example_file.yml
- Import to playbook like import tasks or playbook as 2 ways: 

As preprocess playbook with "vars_file" keyword

```
---
- name: working with variables
  hosts: all
  vars_file: var_example_file.yml
  tasks:
    - name: show port number listed in var_example_file
      debug:
        msg: show item as normal like above task: {{ port_num[3]}
```

As dynamically with "include_vars" keyword:

```
---
- name: working with variables
  hosts: all
#  vars_file: var_example_file.yml
  tasks:
    - name: load the variables
        include_vars: var_example_file.yml
        
    - name: show port number listed in var_example_file
      debug:
        msg: show item as normal like above task: {{ port_num[3]}
```

4. Getting user input

Use the "vars_prompt" keyword to prompt running user enter variable's value at runtime

```
---
- name: Greet user
  hosts: node1
  vars_prompt:
    - name: username
      prompt: What's your name?
      private: no
  tasks:
  - name: Greet the user
    debug:
      msg: Hello {{ username }}
```

> Note: "private: no" will show you see the value's input. by default it's hidden

5. Setting hosts and groups variable 

5.1 host_vars

You can do some tasks at multihosts with corresponde values by using "hosts_var" folder:

- First creating inventory file as follows:

```
[proxy]
node1

[webserver]
node2
node3

[dbserver]
node4
```
- Now create variable files by creating host_vars folder, inside that folder then create variables files which filenames that corresponds to the node hostname:

```
[elliot@control plays]$ mkdir host_vars
[elliot@control plays]$ echo "message: I am a Proxy Server" >> host_vars/node1.yml
[elliot@control plays]$ echo "message: I am a Web Server" >> host_vars/node2.yml
[elliot@control plays]$ echo "message: I am a Web Server" >> host_vars/node3.yml
[elliot@control plays]$ echo "message: I am a Database Server" >> host_vars/node4.yml
```

- Using host_vars in playbook as follows:

```
---
- name: Set motd on all nodes
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Set motd = value of message variable.
      copy: 
        content: "{{ message }}"
        dest: /etc/motd
```

5.2 group_vars

Similarly, you can create group_vars directory then include all group related variables in filenames that corresponds to group name as follows:

```
[elliot@control plays]$ mkdir group_vars
[elliot@control plays]$ echo "pkg: squid" >> group_vars/proxy
[elliot@control plays]$ echo "pkg: httpd" >> group_vars/webservers
[elliot@control plays]$ echo "pkg: mariadb-server" >> group_vars/dbservers
```

6. Understanding variable precedence 

As order from highest to lowest

> 1. Extra var (--extra-vars) : use on commandline, it will overwrite anything
> 2. Variable set on playbook
> 3. Variable set on host_vars or group_vars folder
> Note: If the same variable is set Different levels, the most specific level gets precedence.

## Part 2 Gathering and showing facts

1. Gather variable information

you can retrieve or discover all manged node information it is called facts and Ansible use "setup" module to gather these facts.

`#ansible node1 -m setup`

This is fraction or peice of all the facts related to managed node that you are going to see it displayed on terminal.
Notice that the facts are stored in dictionay or list and they are belong to the "ansible_facts" dictionary variable.
By default the setup module will be called automatically when run playbook.
You can turn off gather fact activity by "gather_facts" paramether defined in header of playbook:

```
---
- name: Set motd on all nodes
  gather_facts: false 
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Set motd = value of message variable.
      copy: 
        content: "{{ message }}"
        dest: /etc/motd
```

2. Show fact's value

you can show fact's value as variable's value use "ansible_facts" dictionarie mentioned as above

```
---
- name: show some facts
  hosts: node1
  tasks:
    - name: display node1 ipv4 address
      debug:
        msg: IPv4 address is {{ ansible_facts.default_ipv4.address }}

    - name: display node1 fqdn
      debug:
        msg: FQDN is {{ ansible_facts.fqdn }} 

    - name: display node1 OS distribution
      debug:
        msg: OS Distro is {{ ansible_facts.distribution }}
```

3. Creating custom facts

- Create a facts file (having suffix extension is .fact) on control node
- Create the /etc/ansible/facts.d directory on managed node(s)
- Copy the fact file (step 1) from control node to managed node(s)

Example playbook used to create folder then copy fact file from control to manged node(s)

```
---
- name: Adding custom facts to node1
  hosts: node1
  tasks:
    - name: Create the facts.d directory
      file:
        path: /etc/ansible/facts.d
        owner: elliot
        mode: 775
        state: directory
        
    - name: Copy cool.fact to the facts.d directory
      copy:
        src: cool.fact
        dest: /etc/ansible/facts.d
```

After run playbook, just doublecheck result:

```
[elliot@control plays]$ ansible node1 -m setup -a "filter=ansible_local"

"ansible_local": {
            "cool": {
                "fun": {
                    "kiwi": "fruit",
                    "matrix": "movie",
                    "octupus": "'8 legs'"
                }
            }
        }
```

## Part3: Capturing output with register in ANSIBLE

Some tasks won't show output information when running playbook. For instance, running command on your managed node with "shell, command, raw" module won't show any output on terminal.
You can use "register" to capture the output of a task and save it to a variable. 

```
--- 
- name: Register Playbook
  hosts: proxy
  tasks:
    - name: Run a command
      command: uptime
      register: server_uptime

    - name: Inspect the server_uptime variable
      debug:
        var: server_uptime

    - name: Show the server uptime
      debug:
        msg: "{{ server_uptime.stdout }}"
```

> Note:
> This case "server_uptime" variable is a dictionay contain alot of information and key of dict. Beside the stdout key, it also contains other keys like: rc (return code), stderr, end (time when comannd finished), start (time when command run).
