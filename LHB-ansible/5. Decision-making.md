# Chapter 6: DECISION MAKING IN ANSIBLE

- Use when statement to run task as conditionaly
- Use block statement to run task as exception handling
- User handler statement to run task when ocuur change

## Chosing when to run tasks
### Using when with facts

```
---
- name: Using when statements playbook
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Detect system OS
      debug:
        msg: This is Ubuntu server
#      when: ansible_facts.distribution == 'Ubuntu'
      when: ansible_facts['distribution'] == 'Ubuntu'
```

### Using when with Registers

```
---
- name: Using when condition with register
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: save the content
      command: cat /etc/os-release
      register: os-release
      
    - name: Detect system os
      debug:
        msg: "running Centos ..."
      when: os-release.stdout.find('CentOS') != -1
```

## Testing multiple condition with when

```
---
- name: Multiple condition and when
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Reboot Ubuntu server
      reboot:
        msg: Rebooting server Ubuntu
      #when: ansible_facts.distribution == "Ubuntu" and ansible_facts.distribution_major_version == 20
      when: ansible_facts.distribution == "Centos" or ansible_facts.distribution_major_version == "Redhat"
```

## Using when with loops

```
---
- name: combine when and loops
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: print out even number in range 2-10
      debug:
        msg: Even number in range is {{ item }}
      loop: "{{ range(2,10) | list }}"
      when: item % 2 == 0
```

## Using when with variables

```
---
- name: 
  hosts: node1
  vars:
    weekend: true
    on_call: "no"
  tasks:
    - name: Run if "weekend" is true and "on_call" is false
      debug:
        msg: "You are free!"
      when: weekend and not on_call | bool
```

## Handling exceptions with blocks
### Grouping tasks with block

```
---
- name: handling failure with block v2
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Handling error example v2
      block:
        - name: normal command
          command: uptime
        - name: bad task
          command: blabla
          ignore_errors: yes
        - name: This will run
          debug:
            msg: "I run since above task error was ignored"
      rescue:
        - name: This will not run
          debug:
            msg: "Error was ignored!... not going to run"
```

### Handling failure with block

```
---
- name: Handling Error playbook
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Handling error example
      block:
        - name: run a command
          command: uptime
        - name: run a bad command
          command: blabla
        - name: This task will not run
          debug:
            msg: "this task will not run since above task failed"        
      rescue:
        - name: Run when block fail
          debug:
            msg: "Block failed, let's to fix it here ..."
      always:
        - name: This will always run
          debug:
            msg: "Whether the blocks has failed or not... I will always run"
```

## Running tasks upon change with handlers

### Running your first handler

```
---
- name: handler first example
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Create engineer group
      group:
        name: engineer
      notify: add-alice

    - name: second task
      debug:
        msg: " Im just another task"

  handlers:
    - name: add-alice
      user:
        name: alice
        groups: engineer
        append: yes

```

After create group on the first time, handler will not be execute because there are not changes on node2 mentioned in task "create engineer group"

### Controlling when to report change

```
---
- name: control change
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: check uptime system
      command: uptime
      notify: handler1
      changed_when: false
    
    - name: Check date on system
      command: date
  
  handlers:
      - name: handler1
        debug:
          msg: " I can handle uptime"
```

to control change in playbook, use "changed_when" keyword.

### Configuring services with handlers

```
---
- name: configuring service with handler
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Edit ssh configuration
      blockinfile:
        path: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
        block: | 
          MaxAuthTries 4
          Banner /etc/motd
          X11Forwarding no
      notify: restart ssh
      
  handlers:
    - name: restart ssh
      service:
        name: ssh
        state: restarted
```

This example use two modules: "blockinfile" or "lineinfile"
