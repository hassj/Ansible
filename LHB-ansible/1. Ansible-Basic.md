## Running Ad-Hoc commands

## configuration

Ansible default configuration file `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`

There two important sections that you need to define in here:

1. [defaults]
> inventory - specifies the path of inventory file
> remote_user - specifies user who will connect to managed nodes and run playbook
> forks - Specifies the number of hosts can manage in parallel; default is 5
> host_key_checking - specifies whether you want to turn on/off SSH host checking; default is True

2. [privilege_escalation]
> become - Activate privilege escalation, default is False
> become_method - method to get privilege, default is sudo 
> become_user - becoming user with high privilege, default is root
> become_ask_pass - specifies whether ask or not ask for privilege password escalation

## Syntax

`ansible host_pattern -m command -a "argument of command"`

## Command vs. shell vs. raw modules

There are three modules that people confuse with one other: command , shell, raw

| Description | command | shell | raw |
| :---        | :---:   | :---: | ---:|
| Run simple commands | yes | yes | yes |
| Run commands with redirections/pipe | no | yes | yes |
| Run command without Python installed on managed node | no | no | yes |
